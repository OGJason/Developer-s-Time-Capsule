Story:
Ever since I was a little kid, my parents bought a family computer, for obviously, the family. I was excited because I wanted to play around it even though I didn't know much about a computer. It was one of those computers with the tower; it was taller than me. I was 5 years old around that time. One time when my parents wouldn't look around the living room, I would sit on the chair and click the big power button on the tower and the little green button on the monitor. I booted up Windows 7 (yes ik). My brothers taught me how to use the computer and what not to click. I was playing games on it, I loved the built in games. And I was playing for hours on the computer. The games are what inspired me to make games, all because I loved how the game ran. And then a couple months later, the computer had a virus and my parents put it in storage. (And that is how I started)
